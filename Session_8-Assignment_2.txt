Problem​ ​Statement​ ​1:

In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats. In a second
state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats. Suppose a simple
random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
	What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican
	voters in the second state than in the first state?

Ans)
	

Find the mean of the difference in sample proportions: E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 = 0.52 - 0.47 = 0.05.

Find the standard deviation of the difference.
σd = sqrt{ [ P1(1 - P1) / n1 ] + [ P2(1 - P2) / n2 ] } 
σd = sqrt{ [ (0.52)(0.48) / 100 ] + [ (0.47)(0.53) / 100 ] } 
σd = sqrt (0.002496 + 0.002491) = sqrt(0.004987) = 0.0706


Find the probability. This problem requires us to find the probability that p1 is less than p2. This is equivalent to finding the probability that p1 - p2 is less than zero. To find this probability, we need to transform the random variable (p1 - p2) into a z-score. That transformation appears below.
z p1 - p2 = (x - μ p1 - p2 ) / σd = = (0 - 0.05)/0.0706 = -0.7082


the probability of a z-score being -0.7082 or less is 0.24


Therefore, the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than in the first state is 0.24.
